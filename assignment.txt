During this phase we want to understand how you can propose and implement a solution for a given problem, as much as explain the decisions made and discuss different possibilities.
Our recommendation is that you implement what is described in the user story provided below and share the source code, so we can review it together during our call.

(Note: this can be replaced by any comparable project that you may have executed before and can also share the source code)

Proposed User Story: "As a user, I want to have an ability to see a list of tasks for my day, so that I can do them one by one".

Please feel free to use any framework and environment.
Here at Docler we are currently paying more attention to topics like TDD, DDD, Event-driven Applications and Containers. Our recommendation is that you implement what is described in the user story provided below as RESTful Web API service and share the source code, so we can review it together during our call.

These are not mandatory for your interview, although we encourage you to overengineer the solution, so if you feel familiar and comfortable with these topics, please feel free to incorporate them in your project.
We wish you good luck with the next phase and we remain available for any clarifications if needed.

The deadline 10 days.

P.S. We don't like Laravel :)
